# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This objective of this portfolio is to show a collection of labs,projects and/or tutorials in multiple IT fileds of my interes such as: Linux Administration; Networking and monitoring NOC and SOC.

Each project is designed as a realistic, hands-on lab simulating real-world scenarios in: security, network analysis, threat detection, and offensive tactics. 
All work is (ethical ,academic and learning focus) built in personal lab environments, and documented to reflect technical depth and problem-solving ability.

##  About Me

I am a cybersecurity practitioner in training, with a focus on developing strong, practical experience in system defense, threat detection, incident response, and offensive techniques.
I build labs to solve real problems, simulate scenarios and understand the how-to.

Besides I have some projects in other IT areas that in the present are not my focus but I should say they involved many days of my life so itd be foolish not to show and demostrate my skylls on those topics like ,as i said, arent my main focus but i can perform on those areas if needed.
