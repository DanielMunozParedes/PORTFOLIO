# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of independently developed cybersecurity labs and projects focused on both defensive and offensive security domains.

Each project is designed as a realistic, hands-on lab simulating real-world scenarios in: security, network analysis, threat detection, and offensive tactics. 
All work is (ethical ,academic and learning focus) built in personal lab environments, and documented to reflect technical depth and problem-solving ability.

##  About Me

I am a cybersecurity practitioner in training, with a focus on developing strong, practical experience in system defense, threat detection, incident response, and offensive techniques.

My learning philosophy is project-driven: I build labs to solve real problems, simulate realistic attacks, create detection logic, and understand both the attacker‚Äôs and defender‚Äôs perspectives.

I am currently exploring the intersection of:
- System hardening (Linux and Windows)
- Network traffic analysis and detection
- SIEM and alert engineering
- Privilege escalation and offensive recon
- Log parsing, automation, and scripting
